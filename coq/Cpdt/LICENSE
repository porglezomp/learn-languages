"Certified Programming with Dependent Types" code license information
<http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CAUTION: Most of the source files in this distribution are NOT
open-source in the usual sense.  See the comment at the beginning of
each source file for its license, which is Creative Commons, oriented
more toward free distribution of books than the usual collaborative
model of open-source software.  The author really is trying to keep
you from remixing your own versions of the book, which MIT Press might
not be too happy about.

However, a few of the library modules used here are sufficiently
useful that they are released separately under a BSD license, included
below.  The author wants to repeat some advice from the book text,
though: please don't use these library modules in real projects.  They
are not designed for any use beside getting the reader up and running
quickly in reading the book.  All of their content, including the
"crush" functionality, is rather trivial to implement from scratch for
your own projects, using the techniques that the book presents.


The following license applies ONLY to the source files:
